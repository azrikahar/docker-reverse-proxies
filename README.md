# Docker Reverse Proxies

This repo aims to show example on how to setup reverse proxy using various reverse proxies available. Since they are essentially resolve the exact same domain, subdomain and subpath, hopefully it gives a better understanding for someone familiar with one of the reverse proxy but not the others.

For a more detailed guide, do kindly refer to [this Reddit thread I posted](https://redd.it/gkyvke) for now. I will most likely transfer them over to their respective folders over here in the future.
## Future plans

- Add `caddy-secure`, `nginx-proxy-secure` and `traefik-secure` folders to showcase HTTPS configuration.
